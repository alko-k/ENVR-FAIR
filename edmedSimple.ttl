        dct:description  "Current and hydrographic measurements were performed in the Archipelago of La Maddalena (Sardinia Island, Italy), as part of an environmental survey. An area with a radius of 10 Km around S. Stefano Island was chosen for the study. Measurements were taken by the former SO in cooperation with the Comitato Nazionale Energia Nucleare (CNEN, the forerunner of ENEA). CTD measurements were taken from the CNR oceanographic vessel MARSILI by means of an automatic probe, designed and constructed in the laboratories of SO and CNEN. The probe consisted of an underwater unit connected to a receiver at the surface. The salinity was calibrated by comparison with discrete samples collected using NIO bottles and analysed by means of a GUILDLINE AUTOSAL salinometer.  The raw data were treated to eliminate measurement errors, to calibrate the measured values, to correct temperature and conductivity for the time constant of the sensors and finally, to produce vertical profiles of temperature, salinity and density at 1 meter depth intervals.  Station coordinates are given in latitude and longitude and time is in GMT. The number of hydrographic stations was 85 in August 1976, 39 in September 1976 and 76 in February 1977."@en ;

The measurements were carried out in the Central Tyrrhenian Sea (42.07deg N, 10.45deg E; 41.23deg N, 10.93deg E) and East of the Strait of Bonifacio (41.55deg N, 10.05deg E) from September 1989 to July 1990, by 3 instrument chains deployed at the vertices of a triangle.  Since October 1990 to 1992 two current meters chains we working in the Sardinia Channel (39.13deg N, 9.80deg E; 39.32deg N, 12.32deg E).  Each chain was equipped with 3 current meters, adjusted to record a full string of data (instrument depth, current speed and direction, temperature and conductivity) with a sampling rate of 30 minutes."@en ;
